# Advent of Code 2023

Here are my solutions to the Advent of Code[^aoc] 2023 challenges. I did the first few days in Kotlin, then switched over to Lua for the rest.

[^aoc]:
    [Advent of Code][aoc] â€“ An annual event of Christmas-oriented programming challenges started December 2015.
    Every year since then, beginning on the first day of December, a programming puzzle is published every day for twenty-five days.
    You can solve the puzzle and provide an answer using the language of your choice.
